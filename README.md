# city_safety: Implementation and analysis of 2 algorithms
  This program reads two files containing: (file 1)a list of cities and (file 2) a list of safety indices. Then according to user input, the program uses linear/binary search to determine how many safety indices are present in the cities. The result is printed to a user-specified file, and the run-time is printed on the command line. The corresponding analysis is documented in report.pdf.
